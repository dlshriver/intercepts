## How to Contribute

### Report a Bug

Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/dlshriver/intercepts/issues).
If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/dlshriver/intercepts/issues/new). 
Be sure to include a **title** and **clear description** with as much relevant information as possible, as well as a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the issue.

### Submit a Patch

Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
<!-- 
TODO: Describe coding conventions, etc.
-->
Every patch should also include relevant tests to show that the patch behaves as intended.
Before opening a pull request with your path, please run the test suite on your local machine to ensure that all tests pass.
To run the test suite simply run coveragepy, as follows:

```bash
$ coverage run
```

> Cosmetic changes that do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of the library will generally not be accepted.
